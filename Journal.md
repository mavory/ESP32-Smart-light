## 1/18/2026 11:26 AM - The beginning of my project!!  

_Time spent: 1.3h_  

I wanted to create **a system** that would be controllable via my **new components** and I managed to come up with a lamp that is **controllable via an end switch** and also **via a big sound microphone**.

_Here’s the breakdown of the setup:_

- ESP32 as the brain of everythinggg
- External LED Strip powered by a 400W MOSFET, which allows me to do smooth "fade-in" and "fade-out" effects and change the brightness...
- Big Sound Module (Microphone) = 2 claps toggle the main light, and 3 claps control the Ring.
- 24-LED Neopixel Ring with 10 different color modes.
- RGB LED (it glows green when turning on and flashes red when turning off).
- Passive Buzzer for feedback, so I know exactly when a command is registered.
- Micro-switch (End-stop) for "offline" control. I'm using the OneButton library so I can click once for on/off, twice for brightness, three times for Neopixel colors, or just hold it for 3 seconds to kill the ring light.

## 1/18/2026 11:49 AM - Component testing  

_Time spent: 0.9h_  

When I had the **idea ready**, I started testing all the components one by one.
First I started with the **big sound module** because I had to **adjust the sensitivity** and it took me quite a while because it seemed to be set to the _absolute maximum_, so it didn't pick up anything... I had to turn it to the **left many times** so that only one LED on the module was lit **and then it worked**!
Then I just tested if everything worked to make sure **everything** worked!

## 1/18/2026 5:41 PM - Connecting components to small breadboards  

_Time spent: 0.8h_  

After **testing** everything I decided to start connecting everything to the breadboard. I didn't want to use the huge one, so I decided to use these **2 small ones and connect them**. 
At first I didn't know how the **pins** were connected and I found out that they were in rows...
First **I had a problem** that I couldn't fit all the things on **GND**, so I thought about how to connect it. I took a jumper and connected it to the next row - _problem solved_.
![1000023968](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODUxMTIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--cb8a595f319fc33b12f54a6033c120b3b65752ff/1000023968.jpg)
  

## 1/18/2026 5:48 PM - Soldering!!  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

After successfully connecting the **components**, I moved on to **soldering** the cables and soldering the **mosfet**!
At first I was wondering how to connect the mosfet, but later I found **documentation** that explained nicely how to connect **GND** and **PWM**...

## Soldering cables:
I cut the cables and then removed the protection. I tinned the cables on all sides and later I was done.
![1000023976](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODUxMjQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--4ad8767dd4549b35d7cb7489b82f6c4284218ef9/1000023976.jpg)

## Soldering the mosfet:
When I had the cables ready, I moved on to the aforementioned mosfet, but I was wondering what cables to use for the connection... I decided to use standard jumpers, but without headers.
![1000023970](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODUxMzEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--e6bc5ff1f91636ffd1f879dcdfaee396701e7fb0/1000023970.jpg)
  

## 1/18/2026 5:52 PM - Testing component connections  

_Time spent: 0.7h_  

When I finished soldering, I started **testing** the mosfet and neopixel ring.
At first, the ring didn't work because I didn't connect it properly to the **GND** common, but I fixed that mistake. The **LED** **strip** worked beautifully and for the first time in my life it even dimmed!
![1000023974](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODUxMzUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--1b5bb73c0caa14432cb64f2bdf04b71e802d8be4/1000023974.jpg)
  

## 1/18/2026 6:01 PM - Component measurement  

_Time spent: 0.9h_  

Before coding, I started **modeling**.
As I always **say**, _TinkerCad_ is the easiest and easiest to learn for me, so I chose this **program** again, but before I **started**, I had to measure all the **components** to make sure they fit and add small **deviations** to them.
![1000023977](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODUxMzgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--08c3b004536e8183984baf597998ee60dc4ae69f/1000023977.jpg)
  

## 1/18/2026 6:22 PM - The beginning of 3D modeling  

_Time spent: 2.2h_  

After measuring and writing down all the sizes, I moved to **TinkerCad**. I created a new project and started **creating**.
I thought about what shape I would make and decided on a **circle** because I could easily insert the **neopixel** **ring** there and everything would fit **nicely**.
I took a piece of paper with the sizes and started calculating how big I would make it... I **decided** that the total circle would be **90x90mm** and then I continued with the hole.
Later I also started making the top **lid**, into which the mined ring will be **inserted**:
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-18 155757](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODUxNjEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--1c0aa017e120e2bdf41c76fa32b5a3e629f98b18/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-18%20155757.png)
  

## 1/18/2026 6:25 PM - Measurement error!  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

When I was checking how to make a large hole for the **neopixel** ring, I also looked at the website of the **store** where I bought it and they wrote **completely different** things there... So I decided that I would continue with my **sizes** anyway, but I would adjust the case to **100x100mm**, and if everything would **fit** there.
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-18 164253](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODUxNjMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--6423e49ea5f416c190af0e991b2be257309e71f1/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-18%20164253.png)
  

## 1/18/2026 6:37 PM - Finishing the top and bottom of the 3D case  

_Time spent: 1.2h_  

After a short break I started making the **3D case** again...
I didn't know exactly how I was going to make the **top** part, but I decided to make a hole at the top for adding **LED strips** later. It took me a while and I think it will need some more **work** anyway... The **hardest part** was probably finding the right place for the **neopixel ring**.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODUxNjYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--b887472011c5a39bf8d0b5033a0ef7dfcb7f81f2/image.png)
  

## 1/18/2026 6:46 PM - Groove for LED strip  

_Time spent: 0.6h_  

Once I had the **3D case** finished, I started working on the **groove** for the led strip.
First I had to create a bracket that would **connect** to the 3D case and the groove would be inserted into it.
I was thinking about what **design** to choose and decided on a regular "**U**" style where the strip would be **glued**.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODUxNzYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--e6ea5ccaaf1cbb5ffdad2ae12496633d488b6134/image.png)
  

## 1/19/2026 9:24 AM - Removing supports and strange things  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

After **printing** the bottom part I started removing the supports. I also had to take a **knife** and cut off the little **bumps** it made near the **holes**...
Once I had it, I took some **sandpaper** and started sanding the **case** to make it look a bit nicer.
![20260118_205242](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU0OTEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--99b2d32476dcfdb7ca8a02dcc3e957e057d58780/20260118_205242.jpg)
  

## 1/19/2026 9:35 AM - Inserting components into the case!!  

_Time spent: 0.9h_  

After successfully modifying the case, I started putting the **breadboard** and components into the case. I had a few **problems** that occurred to me:
- I turned the **breadboard** the wrong way around, so I had to take it **all** out and put it back in, because only one side has a hole for the button, which is placed from the **side**... 💀
- I took out the **components** a few times to put the cables under them, so that **everything** would fit nicely into the case
- I also had to **disconnect** the mosfet and thread the **cable** through the hole so that the **LED** strips could be powered.

_Otherwise, I did the case and things like that well, because the cables fit perfectly in there._
![20260118_211330](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU0OTMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a28ac56fa963b6f8d5a87fdd8cc4852cf20ddafb/20260118_211330.jpg)
  

## 1/19/2026 9:46 AM - Top printing  

_Time spent: 1.4h_  

In my free time I started **printing** the upper part of the **3D case**. Then I took it, modified it again with a **knife**, **sandpaper** and removed the **supports** where I did research for a good removal of the supports and it worked! Anyway, here is an example:
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-19 094125](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU1MDEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--850e70b8b5ba8af2b73a63144e4b6bc18feda92f/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-19%20094125.png)
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-19 094150](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU1MDIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--87ddb4ad0af4240461ef4bb422c4f64307ce35e8/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-19%20094150.png)
I took some quick-drying glue and some **isopropyl alcohol**, which I used to clean **everything** so that there was **no** **grease** and it would stick well...
I applied a small amount of **glue** to the neopixel ring and stuck it into the **hole** for the neopixel just **mentioned**.
![20260118_213228](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU0OTUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--d00a58991207d32d1236ee5f236709a9b3f61857/20260118_213228.jpg)
  

## 1/19/2026 10:06 AM - Thickness error  

_Time spent: 0.6h_  

I thought it would work fine, but here came a **small problem**...
When I tried the **strips** and turned them on on the 3D holder, the light was **shining** through from one side where it shouldn't.
So I went back into the **program** and reworked it to be thicker and not let in light. I also **adjusted** the fill to **100% in BambuLab** studio and added **3 wall perimeters**.
![20260119_094715 (1)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU1MTMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--8e987d0e4edce6861d4c2be9df4734e63576fe3b/20260119_094715%20(1).jpg)
  

## 1/19/2026 10:27 AM - Remodeling :(  

_Time spent: 0.8h_  

When I got the new **piece** printed, I was amazed at how it **still** let in light even though I had enlarged the wall by about **50%**...
So I went **back** into the program and added a few more **millimeters** and hopefully it will be good. Next, I put on the holder for the **LED strips** and it works very well so far!
![20260119_102135](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU1MTUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--65a51ab98ca94fbcf1670b824322ed95e6c56ea3/20260119_102135.jpg)
  

## 1/19/2026 10:33 AM - Start of coding  

_Time spent: 1.4h_  

In the **meantime**, I decided to start making a **code**. Before that, it was just a test code to see if everything works, and now we're going to the **master** **code**!
At first, I didn't know how to **code** it, but gradually I started thinking of **various** other things to **improve** it...
So far, the code can only turn the **led strip** on and off (1x) and clap twice to turn the **ring** on/off.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU1MjEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--6ef274f74745f2dabd0c376f5ca52e61b0fcaa50/image.png)
  

## 1/19/2026 11:46 AM - Continuing coding!!  

_Time spent: 1.1h_  

I continued coding and **decided** that I would like to add some mods for the **ring** and also to dim the led strip.
I achieved this by adding a **OneButton** function to the code, which was there **before**, but I didn't use it that **much**.
I also added the ability to **clap** multiple times and here's what it means:
- **1x** = _turns the led strips on/off_
- **2x** = _turns the neopixel ring on/off_
- **3x** = _changes the sew mode of the neopixel ring_
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU1NzQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--91ba42cc8bcb2c742dc8992f8c7fe222b7cfca8c/image.png)
  

## 1/19/2026 11:57 AM - Gluing the upper part of the holder  

_Time spent: 0.7h_  

When I had some time, I started **gluing** the first part of the **strip** holder.
I thought it would be **easy**, but it wasn't **possible** at all... At first, I just applied **glue** to the holder and tried to let it **dry** - but it didn't work. I had to take a **stronger** **glue** and started adding from both **sides**. It was better, but it still **wasn't enough** (_it was falling to the sides, etc_).
So I put a **big dose of glue** on top and held it for about **20 minutes**, then I turned it over and started adding glue from the other **side** again and it helped! We just **applied** glue a few times, maybe it held even more, but now **I'm** **satisfied**.
![20260119_114646 (1)](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU1NzgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a41a8f4cf5370693fb6fb3bd50daea270023f9db/20260119_114646%20(1).jpg)
  

## 1/19/2026 12 PM - The 3D case is ready!!!  

_Time spent: 1.3h_  

After a long time I finished the **3D case** and glued **everything**.
At first the holders for the **LED strips** didn't hold together, so I had to **sand** them down first and then try to **glue** them...
![20260119_122217](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU2MDksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--4934756756095e2515ca0d631f3b684b1eac9528/20260119_122217.jpg)
I guess the most difficult thing was to somehow straighten it out and do it **right**, because before I always had it either too far **forward** or too far **back**. So now it's level, but I still have to **sand** it a little to fine-tune the **straightness**.
![20260119_123537](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU2MDgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--528c51d16b7ff8ef595a77a7c20971b1ceecad92/20260119_123537.jpg)
  

## 1/19/2026 4:48 PM - Creating a website for the system  

_Time spent: 1.2h_  

I decided that I would like to use one more cool feature of **ESP32** - **WiFi**!
So I thought about how to create a **website**, but so that it works... At first I thought that I could put **buttons** and **sliders** on the website, that was just the **beginning**, but unfortunately when I created the **page**, the system did not work, so later I had to start again and with a **better** **look**!
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-19 160110](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU3NDcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--4e3a71593569770862c8defc244c6216a377d985/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-19%20160110.png)
  

## 1/19/2026 4:55 PM - Continuing to create the website  

_Time spent: 1.6h_  

When I had a finished but **non-functional** website, I decided to completely **redo** it.
I deleted the **code** and started from scratch... I was thinking about what look to use and **decided** to use white and blue with a touch of minimalism!
I gradually added **buttons**, **sliders**, **selections**,.... until I came to a functional **website** that could **control** my system - But it had one flaw:
- When I wanted to turn something **off**/**on** via the button and then turn it **on**/**off** via the website, the website threw me nonsense and **nothing** worked...

### I was missing something there...
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-19 155724](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU3NDksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--22617766735b58a913dd69bba0d19172f440062c/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-19%20155724.png)
  

## 1/19/2026 5:17 PM - Website completion!  

_Time spent: 1.4h_  

After a **few hours** I finished the website!
It took me a long time to get it up and **running**, but I managed to do it... I had to **rework** the logic of the operation. First I thought about adding a "_Demo Mode_" that would constantly **cycle** through all the modes, and I **managed** to do that!
I also fixed the **buttons** and added "_live fetch_" which works as follows:
- I press, for example, a button on the case that turns on the light and on the website the button status also changes to on.

This was probably the **most** **difficult** **part** of the editing, because I was mostly editing and **looking** for errors that were there.

## 1/19/2026 5:21 PM - Language editing  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

To make the page readable for **everyone**, I had to edit the code one last time by **rewriting** the main logic into **English**. It only took me about half an hour and I'm happy for it!
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU3NzMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--8a2ee954ec5aa86d8bbc0480190bb1cb029fe600/image.png)
  

## 1/19/2026 6:00 PM - Finishing the case  

_Time spent: 0.7h_  

As **I** **wrote** before, I still had to finish the case to make it **perfect**. I added a little glue at one point because the **top** **part** was peeling off a little, but that's it.
I also took some finer grit **sandpaper** and sanded the case a little in some **places** because there were still some **glue** residue, some **bumps**, etc.
![20260119_174635](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU3ODgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--7c6fcbc3682a7db4135ed938ef3dc427a462cd6d/20260119_174635.jpg)
  

## 1/19/2026 6:52 PM - Circuit diagram in KiCad  

_Time spent: 0.9h_  

After finishing the **3D case**, I moved on to the schematic, which I always do in **KiCad**. At first, I was thinking about what pins I would use mainly for the **mosfet**, but I decided to use normal...
I then gradually inserted **all** the components and also prepared the connection **symbols**.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU4MzIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--d96c8306f0091306ac5f98153cda076dac1ae83e/image.png)
  

## 1/19/2026 6:57 PM - Circuit diagram is finished!!  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

When I added the **symbols**, I started connecting the components with the **ESP32**. The microphone took me the most time because I forgot to **connect it**, so I had to find it on the internet (_the 3D case was already closed_).
So I finished the last part, rotated a few symbols and renamed the **project**.

## 1/19/2026 7 PM - Preparing things for the GitHub repo  

_Time spent: 0.6h_  

When I was slowly **finishing** my project, I started making **BOM** and preparing things for export to **GitHub**.
